A digital clock is an electronic timekeeping device that displays the current time in a digital format, typically using numerical digits to represent hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds. Unlike traditional analog clocks with rotating hands, digital clocks present time information in a more direct and easily readable manner.

The digital clock described here, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizes a web-based approach to create a visual representation of time on a computer or mobile device. The HTML structure defines a container for the clock, and the JavaScript code is responsible for dynamically updating the displayed time every second.

The key components include:

HTML Structure:

Defines the basic document structure with a container (<div class="clock">) to hold the digital time display.
CSS Styling:

Provides minimal styling to enhance the visual appearance of the clock, setting the font, size, color, and centering the display on the webpage.
JavaScript Functionality:

Defines a function (updateTime) that retrieves the current time, formats it into hours, minutes, and seconds, and updates the content of the designated HTML element (<div id="time">) with the formatted time string.

Uses setInterval to call the updateTime function every second, ensuring that the displayed time is continuously refreshed.

The result is an interactive and dynamic digital clock that accurately reflects the current time. This type of digital clock is commonly used in various applications, from websites and software interfaces to electronic devices, providing users with a clear and easily readable representation of the time
